"""flow control is the order in which statements or 
blocks of code are executed at runtime based on a condition.
control flows are divided into three categories
1.CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS(if , if else, if elif else, nested if else)--acts depending 
on a condition being true or false

2.TRANSFER STATEMENTS (break, continue,pass)
used to alter a programs way of executiion

3.Iterative STATEMENTS (for and while loop)---terative statements allow us to
execute a block of code repeatedly as long as the condition is True
"""

#if condtions execute if the condtion given is true

if number > 5:

"""    
#if else ---this checks if the (if) condition is false...then it runs
